# Provide
Provide's aim to help connect donators to local nonprofits. I plan to continue development, using this as a starting point. The ultimate goal is for this project to help people in my community and in other communities across the country.

## Good Stuff
 - Implemented a cart system: Can add to cart and remove from cart. The cart also shows the total price of all of the items that are currently in the cart.
 - Connected to MongoDB
 - Can log in to accounts that are in Database 
 - On the main page with the products, items are being displayed in their cards. Currently using stock photos which will be replaced by photos that I own.
 


## Bugs
-- Cart after a certain number of items likes to go give $$ values wayyyy beyond two decimal places.
-- pictures are not uniformly sized, however this is because of the photos themselves so that will go away eventually.
